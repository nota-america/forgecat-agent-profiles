# Contributing to Agent Skills

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a collection of production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create a directory under `skills/` with a kebab-case name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` following the format in [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md)
3. Include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
4. Ensure the `description` starts with "Use when" and describes triggering conditions

### Skill Quality Bar

Skills should be:

- **Specific** — Actionable steps, not vague advice
- **Verifiable** — Clear exit criteria with evidence requirements
- **Battle-tested** — Based on real engineering workflows, not theoretical ideals
- **Minimal** — Only the content needed to guide the agent correctly

### Structure

Every skill should include these sections:

- **Overview** — What this skill does and why it matters
- **When to Use** — Triggering conditions
- **Process** — Step-by-step workflow
- **Common Rationalizations** — Excuses agents use to skip steps, with rebuttals
- **Red Flags** — Warning signs that the skill is being applied incorrectly
- **Verification** — How to confirm the skill was applied correctly

### What Not to Do

- Don't duplicate content between skills — reference other skills instead
- Don't add skills that are vague advice instead of actionable processes
- Don't create supporting files unless content exceeds 100 lines
- Don't put reference material inside skill directories — use `references/` instead

## Modifying Existing Skills

- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Preserve the existing structure and tone
- Test that YAML frontmatter remains valid after edits

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue if you find:

- A skill that gives incorrect or outdated guidance
- Missing coverage for a common engineering workflow
- Inconsistencies between skills
