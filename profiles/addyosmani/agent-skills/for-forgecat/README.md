## Installation

```bash

```

## Skills

- **api-and-interface-design** — Guides stable API and interface design. Use when designing APIs, module boundaries, or any public interface. Use when creating REST or GraphQL endpoints, defining type contracts between modules, or establishing boundaries between frontend and backend.
- **browser-testing-with-devtools** — Tests in real browsers via Chrome DevTools MCP. Use when building or debugging anything that runs in a browser. Use when you need to inspect the DOM, capture console errors, analyze network requests, profile performance, or verify visual output with real runtime data. Requires the chrome-devtools MCP server to be configured.
- **ci-cd-and-automation** — Automates CI/CD pipeline setup. Use when setting up or modifying build and deployment pipelines. Use when you need to automate quality gates, configure test runners in CI, or establish deployment strategies.
- **code-review-and-quality** — Conducts multi-axis code review. Use before merging any change. Use when reviewing code written by yourself, another agent, or a human. Use when you need to assess code quality across multiple dimensions before it enters the main branch.
- **code-simplification** — Simplifies code for clarity. Use when refactoring code for clarity without changing behavior. Use when code works but is harder to read, maintain, or extend than it should be. Use when reviewing code that has accumulated unnecessary complexity.
- **constraint-driven-development** — Establishes a project's quality bar as a written contract and stops agents quietly lowering it. Interviews the user on which dimensions matter, supplies sane default thresholds when they have no number in mind, records everything in CONSTRAINTS.md, and watches the diff for a weakened bar — new @ts-ignore or eslint-disable suppressions, skipped or deleted tests, assertions stripped out, unimplemented stubs, thresholds edited down. Use when no quality bar is written down, when the user says "set up constraints" or "define our standards", when the user wants dimensions they care about — accessibility, web performance, coverage — set up as enforced constraints, when an agent keeps silencing checks or skipping tests to get to green, when you need a coverage or performance threshold and don't know what number to pick, or when an agent writes more code than anyone will read.
- **context-engineering** — Optimizes agent context setup. Use when starting a new session, when agent output quality degrades, when switching between tasks, or when you need to configure rules files and context for a project.
- **debugging-and-error-recovery** — Guides systematic root-cause debugging. Use when tests fail, builds break, something that worked yesterday broke, behavior doesn't match expectations, or you encounter any unexpected error. Use when you need to figure out what broke and why — a systematic approach to finding and fixing the root cause rather than guessing.
- **deprecation-and-migration** — Manages deprecation and migration. Use when removing old systems, APIs, or features. Use when migrating users from one implementation to another. Use when migrating a database schema in production, such as renaming or dropping a column without downtime (expand/contract). Use when deciding whether to maintain or sunset existing code.
- **documentation-and-adrs** — Records decisions and documentation. Use when you need to document an architecture decision (ADR) or the reasoning behind a design choice, when changing public APIs, shipping features, or when you need to record context that future engineers and agents will need to understand the codebase.
- **doubt-driven-development** — Subjects every non-trivial decision to a fresh-context adversarial review before it stands. Use when you want every assumption cross-examined before proceeding, when stress-testing a plan for hidden failure modes, when correctness matters more than speed, when working in unfamiliar code, when stakes are high (production auth, security-sensitive logic, a high-stakes migration, irreversible operations), or any time a confident output would be cheaper to verify now than to debug later.
- **frontend-ui-engineering** — Builds production-quality, accessible, responsive user-facing UIs. Use when building or modifying interfaces and pages, creating components, implementing layouts, meeting WCAG accessibility requirements, managing state, or when the output needs to look and feel production-quality rather than AI-generated.
- **git-workflow-and-versioning** — Structures git workflow practices. Use when making any code change. Use when committing, branching, resolving conflicts, splitting uncommitted work in a messy working tree into clean atomic commits, opening or reviewing a pull request (PR), pushing to a remote, or when you need to organize work across multiple parallel streams. Use when cutting a release, choosing a semantic version bump, tagging, or writing a changelog.
- **idea-refine** — Refines raw ideas into sharp, actionable concepts through structured divergent and convergent thinking. Use when an idea is still vague, when you need to stress-test assumptions before committing to a plan, or when you want to expand options before converging on one. Triggers on "ideate", "refine this idea", or "stress-test my plan".
- **incremental-implementation** — Delivers changes incrementally in thin, verifiable slices. Use when implementing any feature or change that touches more than one file, or when picking up the next task from a plan. Use when rolling a change out behind a feature flag, when you're about to write a large amount of code at once, or when a task feels too big to land in one step.
- **interview-me** — Extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want. Achieves this through one-question-at-a-time interview until ~95% confidence about the underlying intent. Use when an ask is underspecified ("build me X" without "for whom" or "why now"), when the user explicitly invokes ("interview me", "grill me", "are we sure?", "stress-test my thinking"), or when you catch yourself silently filling in ambiguous requirements before any plan, spec, or code exists.
- **observability-and-instrumentation** — Instruments code so production behavior is visible and diagnosable. Use when adding logging, metrics, tracing, or alerting. Use when shipping any feature that runs in production and you need evidence it works. Use when production issues are reported but you can't tell what happened from the available data.
- **performance-optimization** — Optimizes application performance across frontend, backend, queries, and databases. Use when performance requirements exist, when you suspect performance regressions, when Core Web Vitals or load times need improvement, when N+1 query patterns need fixing, or when profiling reveals bottlenecks.
- **planning-and-task-breakdown** — Breaks work into ordered tasks. Use when you have a spec or clear requirements and need to break work into implementable tasks. Use when a task feels too large to start, when you need to estimate scope, or when parallel work is possible.
- **security-and-hardening** — Hardens code against vulnerabilities. Use when auditing an input handler for vulnerabilities, when handling user input, authentication, data storage, or external integrations, or when checking a login flow is safe against the OWASP Top Ten. Use when building any feature that accepts untrusted data, manages user sessions, or interacts with third-party services. Use when auditing dependencies for known vulnerabilities, triaging package-manager audit findings, or assessing supply-chain risk in a new package. Use when personal data or privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA) is involved.
- **shipping-and-launch** — Prepares production launches. Use when preparing to deploy to production, or when asking what needs to be in place before shipping. Use when you need a pre-launch checklist, when setting up monitoring, when planning a staged rollout, or when you need a rollback strategy.
- **source-driven-development** — Grounds every implementation decision in official documentation. Use when you want to verify an approach against the official docs before implementing it, or when you want authoritative, source-cited code free from outdated patterns. Use when building with any framework or library where correctness matters.
- **spec-driven-development** — Creates specs before coding. Use when starting a new project, feature, or significant change and no specification exists yet. Use when drafting a PRD or requirements document with objectives and scope, or when requirements are unclear, ambiguous, or only exist as a vague idea. Use when a single requirement spans several independently testable capabilities and needs decomposing into a capability map of modules before specifying.
- **test-driven-development** — Drives development with tests using the red-green-refactor loop. Use when implementing any logic, fixing any bug, or changing any behavior. Use when you need to prove that code works, when a bug report arrives, or when you're about to modify existing functionality.
- **using-agent-skills** — Discovers and invokes agent skills. Use when starting a session, or when you need to decide which skill or workflow applies to the piece of work at hand. This is the meta-skill that governs how all other skills are discovered and invoked.

## Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Senior code reviewer that evaluates changes across five dimensions — correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance. Use for thorough code review before merge.
- **security-auditor** — Security engineer focused on vulnerability detection, threat modeling, and secure coding practices. Use for security-focused code review, threat analysis, or hardening recommendations.
- **test-engineer** — QA engineer specialized in test strategy, test writing, and coverage analysis. Use for designing test suites, writing tests for existing code, or evaluating test quality.
- **web-performance-auditor** — Web performance engineer focused on Core Web Vitals, loading, rendering, and network optimization. Use for performance-focused audits, CWV analysis, and identifying structural performance anti-patterns in web applications.

## Commands

- **build** — Implement tasks incrementally — build, test, verify, commit. Add "auto" to run the whole plan in one approved pass.
- **code-simplify** — Simplify code for clarity and maintainability — reduce complexity without changing behavior
- **constraints** — Define and enforce this project's quality bar — interview, sane defaults, CONSTRAINTS.md
- **plan** — Break work into small verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering
- **review** — Conduct a five-axis code review — correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
- **ship** — Run the pre-launch checklist via parallel fan-out to specialist personas, then synthesize a go/no-go decision
- **spec** — Start spec-driven development — write a structured specification before writing code
- **test** — Run TDD workflow — write failing tests, implement, verify. For bugs, use the Prove-It pattern.
- **webperf** — Run a web performance audit via the web-performance-auditor persona

# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

9 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Set the quality bar | `/constraints` | Decide it once, enforce it everywhere |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

---

## Quick Start

**Fastest path — any agent, one command.** The open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs into 70+ agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more):

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills            # install all 25 skills
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --list     # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill code-review-and-quality   # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill interview-me              # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill test-driven-development   # red-green-refactor, enforced
```

> **Installing one skill?** A per-skill `npx` install copies only
> `skills/<name>/`, not the repo-level `references/` directory. The skill still
> works, but paths to supplementary shared checklists are unavailable. Use a
> whole-repo integration, clone the repository, or copy the needed checklist into
> a `references/` directory inside the installed skill. This portability gap is
> tracked in [#361](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills/issues/361).

Prefer a native integration? Pick your tool below.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (recommended)</b></summary>

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add addyosmani/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@addy-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
> /plugin install agent-skills@addy-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Put workflow skills under `.cursor/skills/` (sync from `agent-skills/skills/`) and short policies in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — do not paste full skills into rules. See [docs/cursor-setup.md](docs/cursor-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity CLI</b></summary>

Install as a native plugin for skills and subagents. In affected Antigravity CLI releases, legacy command TOMLs are reported as converted but their wrapper commands are not discoverable; invoke the underlying namespaced skills directly. See [docs/antigravity-setup.md](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
agy plugin install ./agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b></summary>

Install as native skills for auto-discovery, or add to `GEMINI.md` for persistent context. See [docs/gemini-cli-setup.md](docs/gemini-cli-setup.md).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
gemini skills install ./agent-skills/skills/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Add skill contents to your Windsurf rules configuration. See [docs/windsurf-setup.md](docs/windsurf-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Copy skills to `.opencode/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`), add a project-local `AGENTS.md`, and use the built-in `skill` tool for agent-driven execution. Optional slash commands can be added under `.opencode/commands/`.

See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

Use agent definitions from `agents/` as Copilot personas and skill content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md).

Using the standalone `copilot` CLI? Install it as a plugin — see [docs/copilot-cli-setup.md](docs/copilot-cli-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Kiro IDE & CLI </b></summary>
  Skills for Kiro reside under ".kiro/skills/" and can be stored under Project or Global level. Kiro also supports Agents.md. See Kiro docs at https://kiro.dev/docs/skills/
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

Install as a native Codex plugin (Codex CLI v0.122+):

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add addyosmani/agent-skills
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

The first command registers the marketplace; the second installs the plugin. Codex reads the root `skills/` directory directly through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Once installed, invoke skills in chat using `@` (e.g., `@spec-driven-development`). See [docs/codex-setup.md](docs/codex-setup.md) for local installation and troubleshooting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Command Code</b></summary>

Install natively with the built-in `cmd skills` command. Command Code clones the repo, discovers every `SKILL.md`, and installs into `.commandcode/skills/`:

```bash
cmd skills add addyosmani/agent-skills            # pick skills to install (project)
cmd skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --global   # install for all projects (~/.commandcode/skills/)
cmd skills add addyosmani/agent-skills -s spec-driven-development  # install a specific skill
```

Installed skills show up in the TUI slash menu, e.g. `/spec-driven-development`. See [docs/commandcode-setup.md](docs/commandcode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other Agents</b></summary>

Skills are plain Markdown - they work with any agent that accepts system prompts or instruction files. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Adoption

Already installed? How you roll the pack out depends on your codebase. The **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** covers two paths: the full lifecycle from day one for a greenfield project, or an incremental, verification-first rollout for an established codebase.

---

## All 24 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 25 skills total — 24 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [using-agent-skills](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md) | Maps incoming work to the right skill workflow and defines shared operating rules | Starting a session or deciding which skill applies |

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [interview-me](skills/interview-me/SKILL.md) | One-question-at-a-time interview that extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want, until ~95% confidence | The ask is underspecified, or the user invokes "interview me" / "grill me" |
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |
| [constraint-driven-development](skills/constraint-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Interviews you for a quality bar with sane default thresholds, writes CONSTRAINTS.md, places each check by cost, and catches agents silencing checks or skipping tests to get green | No standards are written down, or an agent is producing more than anyone reads |

### Plan - Break it down

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [planning-and-task-breakdown](skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md) | Decompose specs into small, verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering | You have a spec and need implementable units |

### Build - Write the code

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md) | Thin vertical slices - implement, test, verify, commit. Feature flags, safe defaults, rollback-friendly changes | Any change touching more than one file |
| [test-driven-development](skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Red-Green-Refactor, test pyramid (80/15/5), test sizes, DAMP over DRY, Beyonce Rule, browser testing | Implementing logic, fixing bugs, or changing behavior |
| [context-engineering](skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md) | Feed agents the right information at the right time - rules files, context packing, MCP integrations | Starting a session, switching tasks, or when output quality drops |
| [source-driven-development](skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Ground every framework decision in official documentation - verify, cite sources, flag what's unverified | You want authoritative, source-cited code for any framework or library |
| [doubt-driven-development](skills/doubt-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Adversarial fresh-context review of every non-trivial decision in-flight - CLAIM → EXTRACT → DOUBT → RECONCILE → STOP, with optional user-authorized cross-model escalation | Stakes are high (production, security, irreversible), working in unfamiliar code, or a confident output is cheaper to verify now than to debug later |
| [frontend-ui-engineering](skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md) | Component architecture, design systems, state management, responsive design, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | Building or modifying user-facing interfaces |
| [api-and-interface-design](skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md) | Contract-first design, Hyrum's Law, One-Version Rule, error semantics, boundary validation | Designing APIs, module boundaries, or public interfaces |

### Verify - Prove it works

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [browser-testing-with-devtools](skills/browser-testing-with-devtools/SKILL.md) | Chrome DevTools MCP for live runtime data - DOM inspection, console logs, network traces, performance profiling | Building or debugging anything that runs in a browser |
| [debugging-and-error-recovery](skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md) | Five-step triage: reproduce, localize, reduce, fix, guard. Stop-the-line rule, safe fallbacks | Tests fail, builds break, or behavior is unexpected |

### Review - Quality gates before merge

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [code-review-and-quality](skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md) | Five-axis review, change sizing (~100 lines), severity labels (Nit/Optional/FYI), review speed norms, splitting strategies | Before merging any change |
| [code-simplification](skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md) | Chesterton's Fence, Rule of 500, reduce complexity while preserving exact behavior | Code works but is harder to read or maintain than it should be |
| [security-and-hardening](skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md) | OWASP Top 10 prevention, auth patterns, secrets management, dependency auditing, three-tier boundary system | Handling user input, auth, data storage, or external integrations |
| [performance-optimization](skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md) | Measure-first approach - Core Web Vitals targets, profiling workflows, bundle analysis, anti-pattern detection | Performance requirements exist or you suspect regressions |

### Ship - Deploy with confidence

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [git-workflow-and-versioning](skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md) | Trunk-based development, atomic commits, change sizing (~100 lines), the commit-as-save-point pattern | Making any code change (always) |
| [ci-cd-and-automation](skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md) | Shift Left, Faster is Safer, feature flags, quality gate pipelines, failure feedback loops | Setting up or modifying build and deploy pipelines |
| [deprecation-and-migration](skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md) | Code-as-liability mindset, compulsory vs advisory deprecation, migration patterns, zombie code removal | Removing old systems, migrating users, or sunsetting features |
| [documentation-and-adrs](skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md) | Architecture Decision Records, API docs, inline documentation standards - document the *why* | Making architectural decisions, changing APIs, or shipping features |
| [observability-and-instrumentation](skills/observability-and-instrumentation/SKILL.md) | Structured logging, RED metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, symptom-based alerting - instrument as you build | Adding telemetry, or shipping anything that runs in production |
| [shipping-and-launch](skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md) | Pre-launch checklists, feature flag lifecycle, staged rollouts, rollback procedures, monitoring setup | Preparing to deploy to production |

---

## Agent Personas

Pre-configured specialist personas for targeted reviews:

| Agent | Role | Perspective |
|-------|------|-------------|
| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis code review with "would a staff engineer approve this?" standard |
| [test-engineer](agents/test-engineer.md) | QA Specialist | Test strategy, coverage analysis, and the Prove-It pattern |
| [security-auditor](agents/security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection, threat modeling, OWASP assessment |
| [web-performance-auditor](agents/web-performance-auditor.md) | Web Performance Engineer | Core Web Vitals audit with Quick/Deep modes and a metric-honesty rule; run it via `/webperf` |

See [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) for the decision matrix, orchestration rules, and how personas compose with skills and slash commands.

```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Project Structure

The portable core stays in shared directories. Host-specific paths are native discovery conventions, not branding aliases; renaming or merging them would break the tools that scan those exact locations.

| Layer / consumer | Repository paths | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Shared workflow core | `skills/` (25 skills) | Portable `SKILL.md` workflows used by every integration |
| Shared review material | `agents/` (4 personas), `references/` (7 checklists) | Specialist reviewers and pack-level checklists carried by whole-repo installs |
| Claude Code adapter | `.claude/commands/` (9 commands), `.claude-plugin/`, `hooks/` | Slash-command wrappers, marketplace metadata, and lifecycle hooks |
| Gemini CLI adapter | `.gemini/commands/` (9 commands) | Gemini-native TOML command wrappers |
| Antigravity CLI adapter | `commands/` (9 commands), `plugin.json` | Legacy TOML wrappers and the root plugin manifest; see the [known wrapper limitation](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility) |
| Codex adapter | `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/` | Codex plugin metadata and marketplace registration; Codex consumes `skills/` directly |
| GitHub Copilot CLI adapter | `plugin.json` | Root plugin metadata; Copilot CLI discovers `skills/` by convention and does not register the lifecycle wrappers |
| Contributor tooling | `scripts/` (13 scripts), `evals/` (25 case files), `.github/workflows/` | Validation, routing evals, and CI |
| Documentation | `docs/` | Universal guidance and per-tool setup guides |

Tools without a checked-in adapter directory install or copy the shared `skills/` core into their own native location. The [Quick Start](#quick-start) links the setup guide for each supported host.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

## How it compares

Wondering how this stacks up against [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) or [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)? See **[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)** for an honest, side-by-side look at how the three are shaped differently and when to reach for each — including a link to a controlled [head-to-head experiment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/superpowers-vs-agent-skills-faster-shipping-safer-reasoning-om-mishra-dzakf/).

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
