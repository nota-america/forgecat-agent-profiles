# React Composition Patterns

React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes.

## Conversion and modifications

This profile packages the referenced upstream source in the forgecat profile
structure. The conversion adds `profile.yml`, forgecat installation metadata,
and platform packaging; profile-specific adapters or content changes are noted
elsewhere in this README when present.

# React Composition Patterns

A structured repository for React composition patterns that scale. These
patterns help avoid boolean prop proliferation by using compound components,
lifting state, and composing internals.

## Structure

- `rules/` - Individual rule files (one per rule)
  - `_sections.md` - Section metadata (titles, impacts, descriptions)
  - `_template.md` - Template for creating new rules
  - `area-description.md` - Individual rule files
- `metadata.json` - Document metadata (version, organization, abstract)
- **`AGENTS.md`** - Compiled output (generated)

## Rules

### Component Architecture (CRITICAL)

- `architecture-avoid-boolean-props.md` - Don't add boolean props to customize
  behavior
- `architecture-compound-components.md` - Structure as compound components with
  shared context

### State Management (HIGH)

- `state-lift-state.md` - Lift state into provider components
- `state-context-interface.md` - Define clear context interfaces
  (state/actions/meta)
- `state-decouple-implementation.md` - Decouple state management from UI

### Implementation Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `patterns-children-over-render-props.md` - Prefer children over renderX props
- `patterns-explicit-variants.md` - Create explicit component variants

## Core Principles

1. **Composition over configuration** — Instead of adding props, let consumers
   compose
2. **Lift your state** — State in providers, not trapped in components
3. **Compose your internals** — Subcomponents access context, not props
4. **Explicit variants** — Create ThreadComposer, EditComposer, not Composer
   with isThread

## Creating a New Rule

1. Copy `rules/_template.md` to `rules/area-description.md`
2. Choose the appropriate area prefix:
   - `architecture-` for Component Architecture
   - `state-` for State Management
   - `patterns-` for Implementation Patterns
3. Fill in the frontmatter and content
4. Ensure you have clear examples with explanations

## Impact Levels

- `CRITICAL` - Foundational patterns, prevents unmaintainable code
- `HIGH` - Significant maintainability improvements
- `MEDIUM` - Good practices for cleaner code
