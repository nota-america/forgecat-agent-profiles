# Security Review

Use this skill when the user asks for security review using Ontoly evidence.

## Required Workflow

Follow [the shared Ontoly workflow](reference/workflow.md). Also read [graph evidence rules](reference/graph.md), [MCP usage](reference/mcp.md), [best practices](reference/best-practices.md), and [fallback rules](reference/fallbacks.md) when the task requires detail.

## Ontoly Capabilities

Use these capabilities first: `FindAuthenticationFlow`, `FindResponsibleFunction`, `TraceRequestLifecycle`, `FindConfigurationUsage`, `EvidencePack`.

## Output Contract

Return:

- answer or plan
- capabilities invoked
- graph evidence with node ids, edge types, source spans, and graph hash when available
- confidence: high, medium, or low
- fallback reason if repository files were inspected

## Boundaries

Do not implement compiler, query, MCP, SDK, or business logic in the skill. Do not search repository files until Ontoly cannot answer or evidence must be confirmed.
